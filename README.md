 >  1. According to today's South Korea, most of the people wait in front of the pharmacies to buy the masks to avoid from Novel Coronavirus. 

 >  2. There are some applications on cellphones that show the inventories of the masks of the users' vicinity drugstores, such as "DokDak" and "Mask Scanner". However, the problem is that even though they upload the data of mask stock status of each drugstore by using the provided API, it is meaningless since the masks are sold in 10 minutes, which leads elders to use a old mask for more days to get a new masks.

 >  3. It is quite okay for young adults to wait in the lines. However, for those **elders who are older than 65 years old**, they have mentioned from the interview from YTN that they cannot even wait to buy masks since the masks are sold in 10 minutes because the young ages are waiting from the early morning.
 
 >  4. Waiting in a line is seriously dangerous since the Novel Coronavirus easily spreads out when people are gathered. The elders normally have a weaker or poor immune system so that they are easily exposed to it. 
 
### How can Elderask Solve this problem?
 >  1. Elderask provides a OneTouch reservation app for the elders.
 
 >  2. When using an app, the elders are much familiar to the list format than the map format. Even though applications provide the vicinity pharmacies through the map, elders do not know where they are.
 
 >  3. Elderask provides phone numbers directly to each drugstore on the list so that the elders can call without typing the phone numbers and make a reservation for their masks.
 
 >  4. Elderask will find for the drugstores who are available with the reservation system for the elders. This is going to be easier than we think since the government is pouring some regulations on the purchase of the masks for each person.
 
 >  5. Since the elders made the reservations for their masks, they aa\re not required to wait in the lines. They can visit the drugstores at a certain appointed time.
 
### How different is Elderask from the today's Applications?

 > The product that targeting users are using : Mask Apps such as "DokDok" and "Mask Scanner" & Waiting in a huge line in front of the drugstore.  
 
 > - As the app shows, it only depicts a map with "sold out" status. As mentioned above, Elderask will use this as a small reference for the users, but this will not be the focus work. **"품절", which means "Sold out".**

 > - Elderask will change the map format to a List format, and simply put all the vicinity and reservation embeded drugstores to the application. 
 
 > - As soon as the app is opend, the users(elders) will see the current reservation status.
 > > - Example: "Korea National Pharmacy : 6 / 10 booked already."
 
 > - At near point, Elderask is planning to add a user identification system that allows the reservation if they were born before 1955.
 
### From where will Elderask get user Feedback?

 > - Due to the Novel Coronavirus, it is quite impossible to have a meeting with the elders. We are considering a direct phone call to each of the team members' family members, especially the grandparents ages. 
 
 > - When the small meetings are fine in the near future, we planned to have 4 people meeting from the Incheon Senior Citizens' Center.
