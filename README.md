### Targeting Population
 > * Number of elders in South Korea (over 65): 8,030,000 Population

 ### Current Issues due to the Novel Corona Virus [written 2020.03.15]
 >  1. According to today's South Korea, most of the people wait in front of the pharmacies to buy the masks to avoid from Novel Coronavirus. 

 >  2. There are some applications on cellphones that show the inventories of the masks of the users' vicinity drugstores, such as "DokDak" and "Mask Scanner". However, the problem is that the employees of the drugstores have no time to renew the stock status of their masks and the UI is too complex for the elders to use. 

 >  3. It is quite okay for young adults to wait in the lines. However, for those **elders who are older than 65 years old**, they have mentioned from the interview from YTN that they cannot even wait to buy masks since the masks are sold in 10 minutes because the young ages are waiting from the early morning.>
 
 >  4. Waiting in a line is seriously dangerous since the Novel Corona Virus easily spreads out when people are gathered. The elders normally have a weaker or poor immune system so that they are easily exposed to it. 
 
### How can Elderask Solve this problem?
 >  1. Since the employees of the drugstores cannot renew the inventory, Elderask will be developed as a OneTouch reservation application for the elders.
 
 >  2. When using an app, the elders are much familiar to the list format than the map format. Even though applications provide the vicinity pharmacies through the map, elders do not know where they are.
 
 >  3. Elderask provides phone numbers directly to each drugstore on the list so that the elders can call without typing the phone numbers and make a reservation for their masks.
 
 >  4. Elderask has to find for the drugstores who are available with the reservation system for the elders. This is going to be easier than we think since the government is pouring some regulations on the purchase of the masks for each person.
 
 >  5. Since the elders made the reservations for their masks, they are not required to wait in the lines. They can visit the drugstores at a certain appointed time.
